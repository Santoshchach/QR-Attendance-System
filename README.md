## 📌 About the Project  
The **QR Attendance System** is a web-based application built using the Reflex framework (Python) that enables easy attendance tracking via QR codes. It is designed to make attendance marking faster, more reliable and less error-prone than manual attendance registers.

## ✅ Features  
- Generate unique QR codes for classes, sessions, or users.  
- Scan QR codes using the device camera to mark attendance.  
- Automatic timestamp and student/user verification.  
- Attendance data stored in a database (SQLite by default).  
- Clean, minimal UI and easy deployment.  
- Lightweight, easy to run in educational institutions or small organisations.
